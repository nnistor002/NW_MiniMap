```#Things To Keep in Mind:```

	1) The resolution was intended to be capped at 1600x900 screen resolution or higher. In short, its 
	not intended to be a responsive webapp for anything smaller than that.
  
	2) The “Ring Menu” for Categories can only be accessed using middle mouse button or scroll 
	   wheel click.
  
	3) You will encounter some lag due to image data size of the map. A 700mb (42,000 px by 42,000 px) 
	image of the map was compressed as much as possible (10mb) to still keep high resolution image. 
	It will take a while to load the first time or so. There are better ways to make loading faster 
	like grid loading images triggered by user view or something similar. To be honest I would spend 
	more time on it but I got my idea to a workable state now its time to move on to some other projects 
	I have. Feel free to fork it and take it forward. I’m no pro at coding but at least I can dream of an 
	idea and make it work using code. I’m still learning.
     
	4) If you like the idea feel free to clone and build it using Electron.js for an executable application. 
	Enjoy, sorry for any crap code and has a great day!
